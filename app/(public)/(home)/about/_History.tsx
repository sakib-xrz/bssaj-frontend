          The Bangladeshi Studentsâ€™ Support Association in Japan (BSSAJ) is a
          non-profit, non-political, and student-focused organization
          established to assist Bangladeshi students studying and aspiring to
          study in Japan. Founded in 2025, BSSAJ is committed to providing
          educational, administrative, and cultural support to ensure a safer
          and more enriching academic journey for students. The association
          actively collaborates with educational institutions, government
          agencies, and cultural bodies in both Bangladesh and Japan to promote
          fairness, guidance, and opportunity. BSSAJ also supports its member
          agencies and institutions by facilitating orientation programs, legal
          aid, and cultural training to bridge the gap between students and
          society in Japan.
