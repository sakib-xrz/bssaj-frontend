          <p>
            The Bangladeshi Studentsâ€™ Support Association in Japan (BSSAJ) is a
            non-profit, non-political, and student-focused organization
            established to assist Bangladeshi students studying and aspiring to
            study in Japan. Founded in 2025, BSSAJ is committed to providing
            educational, administrative, and cultural support to ensure a safer
            and more enriching academic journey for students. The association
            actively collaborates with educational institutions, government
            agencies, and cultural bodies in both Bangladesh and Japan to
            promote fairness, guidance, and opportunity. BSSAJ also supports its
            member agencies and institutions by facilitating orientation
            programs, legal aid, and cultural training to bridge the gap between
            students and society in Japan.
